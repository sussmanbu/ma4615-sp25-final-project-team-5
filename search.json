    "text": "This comes from the file data.qmd.\nData Overview\nOur dataset is HIV/AIDS Diagnoses by Neighborhood, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity. The data was originally collected from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), which collected and compiled information on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses reported through March 31, 2021. Specifically, this dataset covers cases diagnosed from calendar years 2016 through 2020. The data were collected to monitor trends in HIV and AIDS diagnoses, enabling public health officials to track disease patterns, guide prevention and treatment strategies, and identify disparities across different neighborhoods and demographic groups within NYC. Cases are stratified by United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhoods, sex, and race/ethnicity, allowing for targeted public health responses. The original dataset can typically be obtained directly from the NYC DOHMH or accessed through official public health data portals maintained by New York City.\nCleaning the Data\nThe first step in cleaning the dataset was filling in missing borough values for data compiled from 2010-13. The original dataset always compiled the neighborhood, but didn’t start including the borough until 2016. Because of the data not being stored according to borough, but having neighborhoods from different boroughs stored in neighboring cells, the fill command couldn’t be used because it would take the last borough value and fill that in for all missing borough values, which would attribute that borough to incorrect neighborhoods. Instead, we made a copy of the original dataset and used a command within the spreadsheet to assign each neighborhood the proper borough and then pasted that command into each blank value and had the spreadsheet fill in the missing values.\nNext, we ensured all variables were stored the same way. In the original dataset, the authors sometimes compiled the same variable in different ways. One of the most common disparities was in how variables with a space in the name were stored. Sometimes, instead of using a space, the authors used a linebreak. When viewing these names in the .csv file or in an imported dataset in R, the difference was invisible, but when trying to perform analysis, R would consider these variables with the same name to be two different variables, due to the linebreak. In order to fix this, all linebreaks were replaced with spaces, which can be seen in our clean_data.R script.\nThere were other ways a slightly different spelling made R consider a variable referring to the same place or people as two different variables. Sometimes, it was due to a lack of a space where there sometimes was a space, as in the neighborhood Upper East Side. In the original dataset, sometimes this was stored as “Upper Eastside.” We added a space to variables stored like this, in order for the variable names to coincide with the actual names of the neighborhoods. Another storage difference was with the Hispanic race variable. Sometimes it was stored as “Latino/Hispanic” and other times as just “Hispanic”; we stored every instance of it as “Hispanic” for simplicity. Finally, we used the complete.cases function to filter out all rows with NA values.\nVisualization\n(1) Bar plots and Box plots\nPurpose: Show total counts or rates across racial groups\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /home/tvlaz/MA415/ma4615-sp25-final-project-team-5\n\ndf &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset\", \"hiv_clean.rds\"))\ndf_clean &lt;- df |&gt;\n  filter(is.finite(`TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`))\n\nggplot(df_clean, aes(x = `RACE/ETHNICITY`, y = `TOTAL NUMBER OF CONCURRENT HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSES`, fill = `RACE/ETHNICITY`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of TOTAL NUMBER OF CONCURRENT HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSES\",\n       x = \"Race/Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"TOTAL NUMBER OF CONCURRENT HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSES\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(df_clean, aes(x = reorder(`RACE/ETHNICITY`, -`TOTAL NUMBER OF CONCURRENT HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSES`), \n               y = `TOTAL NUMBER OF CONCURRENT HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSES`, fill = `RACE/ETHNICITY`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"TOTAL NUMBER OF CONCURRENT HIV/AIDS DIAGNOSES by Race/Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Race/Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"Total Number of AIDS Diagnoses\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Line Charts: Trends Over Time\nPurpose: Show how diagnoses and proportions change over years by race\n\nggplot(df_clean, aes(x = YEAR, y = `HIV DIAGNOSES PER 100,000 POPULATION`)) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\", linewidth = 1, color = \"steelblue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ `RACE/ETHNICITY`, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"HIV Diagnoses per 100,000 Over Time by Race (Linear Fit)\",\n    x = \"Year\", y = \"HIV Diagnoses per 100,000\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_clean$Group &lt;- paste(df_clean$`RACE/ETHNICITY`, df_clean$SEX, sep=\"_\") # group race and sex in a new column \n\ndf_clean2 &lt;- df_clean |&gt;

    "text": "We are currently trying to merge census data with our dataset, to look for more predictors that might contribute to the different HIV/AIDS contractions dynamics we’ve already uncovered. It has been difficult to find datasets that can directly join with our dataset because of the way our original dataset is aggregated, using specific regions within New York City where there is a U.H.F. hospital, but we’ve found some datasets containing useful information that we may merge to further our analysis. Our current next step is to clean the datasets so that joining them with our original dataset can be done. Below are some of the datasets.\n\nPopulation\nThis link contains data on the population of each borough and neighborhood in New York City in 2024. However, the problem is that the division of neighborhoods in this dataset is somewhat different from our original dataset.\n\n\nPrison\nThis link contains population data for neighborhoods that are largely the same as those in our original dataset. However, the problem is that the website does not provide a downloadable dataset.\n\n\nPlanning\nThis link contains more complete data on each neighborhood, including population size, ethnicity, and age. However, we have encountered some problems. First, our original dataset contains a column for neighborhoods. Unfortunately, most census datasets do not base their surveys on neighborhoods. This means that it is difficult for us to directly merge the census dataset into the original dataset. In addition, among the limited data on neighborhoods, the criteria for dividing the boundaries of many neighborhoods are different. New York City has several different sets of rules for defining neighborhoods, such as NTA (Neighborhood Tabulation Areas) and U.H.F (United Hospital Fund Neighborhood). Our original dataset uses U.H.F. This further limits our ability to find a dataset that we can use directly. For the census data, our next step is to see if we can transfer the Neighborhood information from other datasets to our original dataset by defining the boundaries of Neighborhood in our original dataset. If this is difficult to achieve, we may give up Neighborhood and directly merge the data based on borough.\n\n\nEnvironment and Health Data\nThis link is to New York City’s official Environment and Health Data portal. On that website, New York City’s government publishes datasets collected by the American Community Survey on various topics, such as neighborhood poverty, unemployment, and health insurance rates. The particular link above links to neighborhood poverty, but a dataset containing data on the aforementioned categories can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding header on the left side of the page, under the “Datasets” header. Below that, there are datasets on housing and social conditions, such as race, incarceration, and education level. .csv files of every dataset can be downloaded."

    "text": "Since publishing blog post 2, we made a change to our cleaned dataset. In our .csv file, each row categorizes data by borough, neighborhood, race, gender, and year. Typically, there is one row for each category per year. For example, there is one row with data on white males who went to the hospital in Gramercy Park, Manhattan every year; however, in only 2020, this wasn’t the case. In 2020, there were two rows for each category, each with different numbers reported for our HIV/AIDS statistics. For example, only 2020 had two rows with data on white males who went to the hospital in Gramercy Park, Manhattan, and each row completely different data values. In order to aggregate the data in 2020 the same way it’s aggregated every other year, the separate rows were merged together. Because of this, our dataset has approximately 900 fewer rows, but no data’s lost. This was accomplished by going into the .csv file itself, creating a pivot table, and inserting the merged values into the dataset. This new .csv is available in the dataset folder, along with the original dataset, in case we deem it necessary to have the data aggregated that way for 2020 again. Since we see no reason to do so at the present time, our clean_data.R script was edited to use the .csv with the merged rows.\nFurther cleaning to the dataset was done as well. Similar to the issue with the way the race variable “Asian/Pacific Islander” was stored last blog post, all entries that had a space in the name, like Gramercy Park, were stored two different ways in the dataset, although invisible when looking at a table. Sometimes, the would be stored with a linebreak to create a space, instead of using the space bar. For the ease of looking at the names in a table, we removed the linebreaks and replaced them with spaces. We also added spaces to some names. For neighborhoods with “east side” or “west side” in their names, like Upper East Side, they were sometimes stored as “eastside” and “westside” in the dataset, without the space. We added spaces so they would match with the proper spelling of the neighborhoods.\nFinally, we made preliminary changes to our data page."

    "text": "Dataset 1: HIV/AIDS Diagnoses by Neighborhood, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity\nThis dataset consists of 8,976 rows and 11 columns, detailing various statistics on HIV and AIDS diagnoses in each borough of New York City and then each neighborhood in each borough from 2016 through 2020. This data is further grouped by race/ethnicity and sex. The data was reported to New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and includes fields such as the number of HIV diagnoses, AIDS diagnoses, and their respective rates per 100,000 population, along with information on concurrent diagnoses and proportions.\nThe main aspects we wish to analyze are any trends in HIV/AIDS diagnoses over time, variations across neighborhoods and demographic groups, and the proportion of concurrent HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Challenges include dealing with missing or inconsistent data as well as cleaning the dataset.\n\n\nDataset 2: Health conditions among children under age 18, by selected characteristics: United States\nThis dataset contains 2,744 rows and 16 columns. The data focuses on health conditions among children under 18 years old in the United States, categorized by various characteristics, such as specific health conditions, age groups, and whether or not the child was insured. The data was collected through the National Health Interview Survey over many years, ranging from the late 1990s to the late 2010s.\nThe main questions to address include identifying trends in health conditions by race groups, how these conditions are distributed across various subcategories and the effect these additional variables have on those trends. The challenge will be to clean the dataset and condense information-dense columns, such as STUB_LABEL, into a format easier to read and work with in RStudio.\n\n\nDataset 3: Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Women, Infant, and Child\nThis dataset contains 12,852 rows and 31 columns. The dataset includes information on children aged 3 months to 4 years old on their nutrition and obesity status, as well as information about the geographical location, demographics, health-related questions, race/ethnicity, age, and the year. The data was collected from Women, Infant, and Children Participant and Program Characteristics (WIC-PC).\nThrough working with this dataset, we will analyze any possible discrepancies in the nutrition and weight of young children across different races/ethnicities, as well the impact additional factors like location have on these potential discrepancies. A potential challenge we may face during the data cleaning process is how we can deal with the missing values regarding the low completeness of the demographic columns. Another challenge lies in the large amount of redundant information contained within this dataset. Much of the data does not directly contribute to addressing our main question, such as columns Class and Topic. It is necessary to establish an effective data filtering mechanism to quickly identify valuable information. We may also need to rearrange the dataset because the chronological order is messed up in this dataset."

(“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "We chose to analyze the dataset about HIV cases in New York City.\n\nData Background\nWhere does the data come from? Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source?\nThe data originates from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), which collected and compiled information on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses reported through March 31, 2021. Specifically, this dataset covers cases diagnosed from calendar years 2016 through 2020. The data were collected to monitor trends in HIV and AIDS diagnoses, enabling public health officials to track disease patterns, guide prevention and treatment strategies, and identify disparities across different neighborhoods and demographic groups within NYC. Cases are stratified by United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhoods, sex, and race/ethnicity, allowing for targeted public health responses. The original dataset can typically be obtained directly from the NYC DOHMH or accessed through official public health data portals maintained by New York City.\nAre there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?\nThe sample population originally includes 8,976 observations. After removing observations that had null entries, the sample size decreased to 7,062. The dataset should be highly accurate, given that the data was collected by a government organization. Additionally, providers and labs are legally required to report any new diagnoses of HIV and AIDS. One way the sample could be biased is that there could be people who don’t get their HIV/AIDS diagnosed, and therefore they wouldn’t be represented in this dataset. This could be a problem if there are a large number of people not reporting their symptoms, and if the people in this group share similar characteristics and/or demographics.\n\n\nData for Equity\nGiven this is a highly sensitive dataset, it is important to be mindful and intentional when collecting and analyzing data. When looking at the instrumentation of the data, it is important to keep beneficence in mind and “Minimize the amount of personally identifiable information collected.” In this instance, NYC DOHMH asked for the respondent’s neighborhood, which is highly granular and potentially sensitive data. To counteract any risks of re-identification, DOHMH doesn’t ask for many other significant demographics, only “borough”, “race/sex”, and “ethnicity”. Additionally, DOHMH lists that one of the reasons for “N/A” cells in the dataset is cell suppression. According to NCES.ed.gov, one of the benefits of cell suppression is “protecting frequency data in tabular form”. However, as mentioned before, the N/A observations do lower our sample size, which could disproportionately affect a certain population or demographic when doing our analysis.\nWhen looking at the collection of data, “respect for persons” is very important. According to the data description, it seems that the HIV/AIDS data is collected through labs and doctors, not patients themselves. Given this, it is important for there to be some level of consent and awareness of this data collection practice by patients. As we mentioned before, re-identification is a risk when collecting such granular and sensitive data, so it is important to make patients aware and get their consent about these data-collecting practices.\n\n\nData Loading and Cleaning\nThe .rds file of our clean dataset was created successfully. The data was in a relatively clean state, with three revisions made so far. First, while the data from 2016-2021 has neighborhoods listed as well as the borough, the data from 2010-2013 only had the neighborhood, so the boroughs had to be filled in. We couldn’t use the fill function because the data wasn’t stored sequentially, so matching each neighborhood to a borough and filling in the boroughs in the csv file itself was the easiest way to do this. Second, all rows with any NA values were removed, using the complete.cases function from R’s documentation. Third, the dataset itself stored the Asian/Pacific Islander race in different ways, despite the spelling being the same in the csv file, using a line break instead of a space sometimes, which was fixed using a combination of str_replace_all and str_trim.\nBelow is some basic code for a boxplot of the total number of HIV diagnoses, grouped by race.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(here))\n\ndf &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset\", \"hiv_clean.rds\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = `RACE/ETHNICITY`, y = `TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`, fill = `RACE/ETHNICITY`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of HIV Diagnoses by Race/Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Race/Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"Total Number of HIV Diagnoses\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, 100)\n\nWarning: Removed 327 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is code for a bar chart, grouped by race.\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = reorder(`RACE/ETHNICITY`, -`TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`), \n                        y = `TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`, fill = `RACE/ETHNICITY`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Total HIV Diagnoses by Race/Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Race/Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"Total Number of HIV Diagnoses\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these graphs, some trends noticed are higher levels of cases for Black and Hispanic people, compared to other races, despite lower populations, indicating potential underlying causes of this discrepancy. The “races” all, other/unknown, and unknown will be removed in further analysis."

    "text": "We began to explore several trends we noticed during our data analysis more thoroughly.\nFrom “Line Charts: Trends Over Time (data.qmd)”, the increase is observed only in the Asian/Pacific Islander category, even though a general reduction in HIV diagnoses rates over time across all racial/ethnic groups.\n##Comparing “Total Number of HIV Diagnoses” by Sex for Asian/Pacific Islanders\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere() starts at /home/tvlaz/MA415/ma4615-sp25-final-project-team-5\n\ndf &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset\", \"hiv_clean.rds\"))\n\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = SEX, y = as.numeric(`TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`), fill = SEX)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total HIV Diagnoses for Asian/Pacific Islanders by Sex\",\n       x = \"Sex\",\n       y = \"Total Number of HIV Diagnoses\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph clearly indicates a significant gender disparity in HIV diagnoses among Asian/Pacific Islanders, with males accounting for a substantially higher number of cases compared to females. The number of diagnoses among males is several times higher than that among females, highlighting a pronounced vulnerability or increased risk exposure for males in this population.\n##Line Graph of HIV Diagnoses Rates per 100,000 Population Over Years by Sex\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = YEAR, y = as.numeric(`HIV DIAGNOSES PER 100,000 POPULATION`), color = SEX)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"HIV Diagnoses Rates (per 100,000) for Asian/Pacific Islanders by Sex\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"HIV Diagnoses per 100,000 Population\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(df$YEAR))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of HIV diagnoses for males (blue dots) is consistently higher than for females (green dots) across all years. Noticeably high spikes occur, especially around 2010-2013 and again in 2017-2018.\nFor statistical modeling, we will need to do two types of modeling, depending on the variable(s) we want to analyze. For example, some of our variables, like “Total Number of HIV Diagnoses,” are count variables, making Poisson regression the best choice for modeling. For other variables, like “HIV Diagnoses Per 100,000 Population,” we can do linear regression, since these are continuous variables. Below is the preliminary statistical analysis exploring the relationship between “Total Number of HIV Diagnoses” and “Race/Ethnicity,” using “White” as the reference variable. As stated above, because “Total Number of HIV Diagnoses” is a count variable, it fits best with a Poisson model.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidymodels))\n\nhiv_clean &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"dataset\", \"hiv_clean.rds\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!`RACE/ETHNICITY` %in% c(\"All\", \"Unknown\", \"Other/Unknown\"))\n\nsplit &lt;- initial_split(hiv_clean, prop = 0.8)\ntraining &lt;- training(split)\ntraining$`RACE/ETHNICITY` &lt;- factor(training$`RACE/ETHNICITY`)\ntraining$`RACE/ETHNICITY` &lt;- relevel(training$`RACE/ETHNICITY`, ref = \"White\")\n\nmod &lt;- glm(`TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES` ~ `RACE/ETHNICITY`, family = poisson, training)\nsummary(mod)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = `TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES` ~ `RACE/ETHNICITY`, \n    family = poisson, data = training)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n   Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max  \n-8.374  -4.788  -2.550  -0.442  83.068  \n\nCoefficients:\n                                       Estimate Std.

Asian/Pacific Islanders have an approximate rate ratio of e^(-0.73989) ≈ 0.477. Asian/Pacific Islanders have 0.477 times as many, or approximately 52.3% fewer, HIV diagnoses as white people. For black people, the rate ratio is e^(1.03738) ≈ 2.82, meaning they have approximately 2.82 times as many, or 282% more diagnoses than white people. For Hispanic people, the rate ratio is approximately 2.48, meaning they have 2.48 times as many cases as white people. For multiracial people, the rate ratio is 0.017, meaning they have about 98.3% fewer cases than white people. Finally, for Native Americans, the rate ratio is 0.00073, meaning they have about 99.93% fewer cases than white people. Every z-value is &gt; |10|, meaning indicating race has a very strong correlation with HIV diagnoses, which is confirmed by the p-values all being &lt;2e-16, indicating statistical significance.\nA point of concern is with the deviance residuals and potential overdispersion. The median is negative, indicating the model tended to overestimate the number of HIV diagnoses; however, the max is 70.741, meaning the model grossly underestimated the number of cases at some point. Combining this with a minimum of -7.842 suggests some observations poorly fit the model, indicating potential overdispersion of the dataset. Checking for overdispersion can be done by dividing the residual deviance by the degrees of freedom, which in our case = 159079/3655 ≈ 43.52, confirming the suspicion of overdispersion. In future analysis, changing the model to better account for this overdispersion will be done, in order to achieve the best estimates possible. Likely, this will involve using a negative binomial distribution, which allows the variance to be greater than the mean, unlike the Poisson distribution, which assumes the mean and variance are equal."

    "text": "For this week’s blog post, we devoted most of our effort into brainstorming how we’re going to present the data on our website. We tried to put ourselves in the place of someone who has no idea what we’re analyzing and determine the best way to make our findings comprehensible to this person. We decided the best way to begin was by displaying a series of basic plots displaying the most basic aspects of our data. For example, below are two plots. One displays the total number of HIV cases in each borough and the other displays the total number of HIV cases for each race. This seemed like the first logical step because when someone reads that we’re analyzing HIV data, the first thing they probably think is, “How many cases are there?”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we made these basic plots, we decided the next step is to identify any trends and do slightly below surface-level analysis on them. We made other plots we plan to include on our final website and one trend we noticed is that Brooklyn always had the most total cases for boroughs, and black people always had the most total cases for race. When someone sees these raw totals, the first thing we anticipate them wondering is, “Well, is this just because there are more people in Brooklyn than the other boroughs and more black people than any other race?”. To assuage these concerns, we move to slightly below surface-level analysis, which is adjusting for population. Below are two plots. They are boxplots displaying the number of HIV cases per 100,000 people for each borough and race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots should answer that basic question of normalizing population. For example, in the boroughs plot, we see the question about total population did have an impact on Brooklyn having the most total HIV cases, as the boxplots display, it has the third highest average number of HIV cases per 100,000, despite having the most total HIV cases, indicating that if all boroughs had the same population, Brooklyn might not have the most total cases. When it comes to race, however, we see population had little-to-no affect; black people had the most total cases and the hgihest number of average cases per 100,000 people.\nThe next question we anticipate people wondering is, “Do the boroughs with more cases have more black and Hispanic people than boroughs with fewer cases?”. Since black and Hispanic people have more cases on average than white and Asian/Pacific Islanders, it seems logical that the boroughs with more cases have more of those demographics. Below are two plots. Each is a map of New York City, broken down into 42 smaller neighborhoods, based on the locations served by UHF hospitals. The first displays areas based on the proportion of black residents, and the second displays the proportion of Hispanic residents in each neighborhood. The data on proportions came from New York City’s official Environment and Health data portal, one of the datasets we wrote about in our previous blog post and the shapefiles were downloaded online.\n\n\nLinking to GEOS 3.11.1, GDAL 3.6.2, PROJ 9.1.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe anticipate that readers will have their next concerned assuaged by this map. In case anyone isn’t familiar with NYC’s geography, the western island is Staten Island, the southwestern portion of the city is Brooklyn, the southeastern portion is Queens, the northwestern portion is Manhattan, and the northeastern portion is the Bronx. As displayed by the maps, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan, the areas with the highest total and average number of cases, have the most black and Hispanic residents, while Queens and Staten Island, which have the fewest cases, have fewer black and Hispanic residents.\nThe next question we anticipate readers to ask is why do areas with more black and Hispanic residents have more HIV cases and this is what we will continue to analyze for the duration of the semester."
