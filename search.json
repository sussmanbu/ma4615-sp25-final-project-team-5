    "text": "Dataset 1: HIV/AIDS Diagnoses by Neighborhood, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity\nThis dataset consists of 8,976 rows and 11 columns, detailing various statistics on HIV and AIDS diagnoses in each borough of New York City and then each neighborhood in each borough from 2016 through 2020. This data is further grouped by race/ethnicity and sex. The data was reported to New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and includes fields such as the number of HIV diagnoses, AIDS diagnoses, and their respective rates per 100,000 population, along with information on concurrent diagnoses and proportions.\nThe main aspects we wish to analyze are any trends in HIV/AIDS diagnoses over time, variations across neighborhoods and demographic groups, and the proportion of concurrent HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Challenges include dealing with missing or inconsistent data as well as cleaning the dataset.\n\n\nDataset 2: Health conditions among children under age 18, by selected characteristics: United States\nThis dataset contains 2,744 rows and 16 columns. The data focuses on health conditions among children under 18 years old in the United States, categorized by various characteristics, such as specific health conditions, age groups, and whether or not the child was insured. The data was collected through the National Health Interview Survey over many years, ranging from the late 1990s to the late 2010s.\nThe main questions to address include identifying trends in health conditions by race groups, how these conditions are distributed across various subcategories and the effect these additional variables have on those trends. The challenge will be to clean the dataset and condense information-dense columns, such as STUB_LABEL, into a format easier to read and work with in RStudio.\n\n\nDataset 3: Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Women, Infant, and Child\nThis dataset contains 12,852 rows and 31 columns. The dataset includes information on children aged 3 months to 4 years old on their nutrition and obesity status, as well as information about the geographical location, demographics, health-related questions, race/ethnicity, age, and the year. The data was collected from Women, Infant, and Children Participant and Program Characteristics (WIC-PC).\nThrough working with this dataset, we will analyze any possible discrepancies in the nutrition and weight of young children across different races/ethnicities, as well the impact additional factors like location have on these potential discrepancies. A potential challenge we may face during the data cleaning process is how we can deal with the missing values regarding the low completeness of the demographic columns. Another challenge lies in the large amount of redundant information contained within this dataset. Much of the data does not directly contribute to addressing our main question, such as columns Class and Topic. It is necessary to establish an effective data filtering mechanism to quickly identify valuable information. We may also need to rearrange the dataset because the chronological order is messed up in this dataset."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "We chose to analyze the dataset about HIV cases in New York City.\n\nData Background\nWhere does the data come from? Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source?\nThe data originates from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH), which collected and compiled information on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses reported through March 31, 2021. Specifically, this dataset covers cases diagnosed from calendar years 2016 through 2020. The data were collected to monitor trends in HIV and AIDS diagnoses, enabling public health officials to track disease patterns, guide prevention and treatment strategies, and identify disparities across different neighborhoods and demographic groups within NYC. Cases are stratified by United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhoods, sex, and race/ethnicity, allowing for targeted public health responses. The original dataset can typically be obtained directly from the NYC DOHMH or accessed through official public health data portals maintained by New York City.\nAre there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?\nThe sample population originally includes 8,976 observations. After removing observations that had null entries, the sample size decreased to 7,062. The dataset should be highly accurate, given that the data was collected by a government organization. Additionally, providers and labs are legally required to report any new diagnoses of HIV and AIDS. One way the sample could be biased is that there could be people who don’t get their HIV/AIDS diagnosed, and therefore they wouldn’t be represented in this dataset. This could be a problem if there are a large number of people not reporting their symptoms, and if the people in this group share similar characteristics and/or demographics.\n\n\nData for Equity\nGiven this is a highly sensitive dataset, it is important to be mindful and intentional when collecting and analyzing data. When looking at the instrumentation of the data, it is important to keep beneficence in mind and “Minimize the amount of personally identifiable information collected.” In this instance, NYC DOHMH asked for the respondent’s neighborhood, which is highly granular and potentially sensitive data. To counteract any risks of re-identification, DOHMH doesn’t ask for many other significant demographics, only “borough”, “race/sex”, and “ethnicity”. Additionally, DOHMH lists that one of the reasons for “N/A” cells in the dataset is cell suppression. According to NCES.ed.gov, one of the benefits of cell suppression is “protecting frequency data in tabular form”. However, as mentioned before, the N/A observations do lower our sample size, which could disproportionately affect a certain population or demographic when doing our analysis.\nWhen looking at the collection of data, “respect for persons” is very important. According to the data description, it seems that the HIV/AIDS data is collected through labs and doctors, not patients themselves. Given this, it is important for there to be some level of consent and awareness of this data collection practice by patients. As we mentioned before, re-identification is a risk when collecting such granular and sensitive data, so it is important to make patients aware and get their consent about these data-collecting practices.\n\n\nData Loading and Cleaning\nThe .rds file of our clean dataset was created successfully. The data was in a relatively clean state, with three revisions made so far. First, while the data from 2016-2021 has neighborhoods listed as well as the borough, the data from 2010-2013 only had the neighborhood, so the boroughs had to be filled in. We couldn’t use the fill function because the data wasn’t stored sequentially, so matching each neighborhood to a borough and filling in the boroughs in the csv file itself was the easiest way to do this. Second, all rows with any NA values were removed, using the complete.cases function from R’s documentation. Third, the dataset itself stored the Asian/Pacific Islander race in different ways, despite the spelling being the same in the csv file, using a line break instead of a space sometimes, which was fixed using a combination of str_replace_all and str_trim.\nBelow is some basic code for a boxplot of the total number of HIV diagnoses, grouped by race.\n\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))\nsuppressPackageStartupMessages(library(here))\n\ndf &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset\", \"hiv_clean.rds\"))\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = `RACE/ETHNICITY`, y = `TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`, fill = `RACE/ETHNICITY`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +  \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of HIV Diagnoses by Race/Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Race/Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"Total Number of HIV Diagnoses\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  ylim(0, 100)\n\nWarning: Removed 316 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is code for a bar chart, grouped by race.\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = reorder(`RACE/ETHNICITY`, -`TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`), \n                        y = `TOTAL NUMBER OF HIV DIAGNOSES`, fill = `RACE/ETHNICITY`)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Total HIV Diagnoses by Race/Ethnicity\",\n       x = \"Race/Ethnicity\",\n       y = \"Total Number of HIV Diagnoses\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these graphs, some trends noticed are higher levels of cases for Black and Hispanic people, compared to other races, despite lower populations, indicating potential underlying causes of this discrepancy. The “races” all, other/unknown, and unknown will be removed in further analysis."

This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Stage and commit the files just like you would any other file.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour clean_data.R file in the scripts folder is the file where you will import the raw data that you download, clean it, and write .rds file(s) (using write_rds) that you’ll load in your analysis page. If desirable, you can have multiple scripts that produce different derived data sets, just make sure to link to them on this page.\nYou should never use absolute paths (eg. /Users/danielsussman/path/to/project/ or C:\\MA415\\\\Final_Project\\). Instead, use the here function from the here package to avoid path problems.\n\n\nClean data script\nThe idea behind this file is that someone coming to your website could largely replicate your analyses after running this script on the original data sets to clean them. This file might create a derivative data set that you then use for your subsequent analysis. Note that you don’t need to run this script from every post/page. Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which will usually be .rds files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."
